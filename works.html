<h3>Inspiration & Creative POV</h3>
<p>
    Erica Schaub’s inspiration as a designer is deeply rooted in her early passion for album art, gig posters, and merchandise from her favorite punk bands, which ignited her love for visual storytelling. Her artistic journey flourished in high school, where she excelled in the fine arts with a particular affinity for printmaking techniques like screen printing, lithography, etching, and linoblock. All of this laid the groundwork for her appreciation of lowbrow art, comic books, and pop surrealism, which infuse her illustrative work with vibrant energy and personality (as seen in works such as <a href="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6112e9a19d4ee10c3e051924/1663355464242-MD2SV4GST2GMRM8JRQTG/Monstercat-Template-Nonsens-%26-SNAVS-Golden-small.jpg?format=500w">personal favourite artwork for NONSENS</a>). Additionally, for her more commercial projects, Erica draws inspiration from historical art and design movements such as Arts & Crafts, Art Deco, and Art Nouveau, reflecting her belief in the power of design to blend beauty with functionality in contemporary contexts.</p>
